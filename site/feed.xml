    <title>langchain - langchain-core 1.2.16</title>
    <link>https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain</link>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <h3>🚀 What's New</h3>
<p>This release fixes a critical issue in the merge functionality where empty tool chunk IDs were being treated as valid instead of missing, which could cause incorrect merging behavior in tool call processing.</p>
<h3>💡 Why It Matters</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fix for empty tool chunk ID handling</strong>: Previously, when merging tool call chunks, empty tool chunk IDs were incorrectly treated as valid identifiers rather than missing values. This could lead to incorrect merging behavior where tool calls with empty IDs would be incorrectly associated with other tool calls. The fix ensures that empty tool chunk IDs are properly treated as missing, preventing incorrect associations and ensuring accurate tool call merging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🛠️ Try It Out</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">from langchain_core.tools import merge_tool_calls

# Example showing correct behavior after the fix
# Previously, empty tool chunk IDs could cause incorrect merging
# Now they are properly treated as missing

tool_calls = [
    {'tool': 'search', 'arguments': 'query1', 'tool_call_id': '1'},
    {'tool': 'search', 'arguments': 'query2', 'tool_call_id': ''},  # Empty ID
    {'tool': 'search', 'arguments': 'query3', 'tool_call_id': '3'}
]

# The merge will now correctly handle the empty ID
merged_calls = merge_tool_calls(tool_calls)
print(merged_calls)</code></pre>

    <title>anthropic-sdk-python - 0.84.0 - MCP Tools, CLI Changes, and Documentation Updates</title>
    <link>https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python</link>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <h3>🚀 What's New</h3>
<p>This release introduces conversion helpers for MCP tools, prompts, and resources, removes the publishing section from the CLI target, changes array format to brackets, and includes various internal improvements and documentation updates.</p>
<h3>💡 Why It Matters</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>MCP Tools Conversion Helpers</strong>: The addition of conversion helpers for MCP tools, prompts, and resources significantly streamlines the integration process between Claude SDK and Model Context Protocol tools. Previously, developers had to manually handle the conversion between SDK types and MCP tool formats, which was error-prone and time-consuming. Now, with built-in helpers, developers can seamlessly convert between these formats, reducing boilerplate code and potential conversion errors. This is particularly valuable for teams building complex agent workflows that leverage both Claude SDK and MCP tools, as it eliminates a common integration friction point and ensures type safety throughout the conversion process.</li>
<li><strong>CLI Target Publishing Section Removal</strong>: The removal of the publishing section from the CLI target simplifies the command-line interface by eliminating unnecessary configuration options. Previously, the publishing section cluttered the CLI help output and could confuse users who weren't familiar with the publishing workflow. This cleanup makes the CLI more intuitive and focused on core functionality, reducing cognitive load for new users and improving the overall developer experience. The change also reduces the maintenance burden for the SDK team by removing rarely-used or deprecated features from the public interface.</li>
<li><strong>Array Format Change to Brackets</strong>: Changing the array format to brackets standardizes the SDK's behavior with common web conventions and improves compatibility with various API endpoints. This change ensures consistent parameter serialization across different HTTP clients and servers, reducing the likelihood of API integration issues. For developers working with APIs that expect bracket notation for array parameters (like PHP or some REST APIs), this change eliminates the need for manual parameter formatting or custom serialization logic, making the SDK more predictable and easier to use in diverse environments.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation Rebranding</strong>: The rebranding to 'Claude SDK' and streamlined README provides clearer positioning and improved discoverability for the project. This change helps users immediately understand the SDK's purpose and relationship to Claude, reducing confusion with other Anthropic products. The streamlined documentation structure makes it easier for developers to find relevant information quickly, improving onboarding time and reducing support overhead. This is particularly important for open-source projects where clear documentation directly impacts adoption rates and community growth.</li>
</ul>

    <title>agno - v2.5.5 - Slack Interface, ModelsLabTools Image Generation, and Bug Fixes</title>
    <link>https://github.com/agno-agi/agno</link>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <h3>🚀 What's New</h3>
<p>This release introduces real-time streaming for Slack interfaces with live progress cards, extends ModelsLabTools to support image generation via text-to-image API, and includes several bug fixes for Gemini, AWS Bedrock, workflows, and knowledge filters.</p>
<h3>💡 Why It Matters</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slack Interface Real-time Streaming</strong>: Previously, Slack responses were static and didn't show progress during tool calls or reasoning steps. This update enables live progress cards that stream in real-time, providing users with immediate feedback on agent activities. Each Slack instance can now have its own token and signing_secret, allowing multiple bots on the same server with isolated configurations.</li>
<li><strong>ModelsLabTools Image Generation</strong>: ModelsLabTools now supports image generation through ModelsLab's text-to-image API, completing the full media suite. This enables agents to generate images programmatically as part of their workflows, expanding creative and visual capabilities for applications that require dynamic image creation.</li>
<li><strong>Gemini API Empty Message Fix</strong>: Fixed a critical issue where empty message parts would cause request failures when sending conversations to the Gemini API. This ensures reliable communication with Gemini models even when message content is minimal or contains empty segments, preventing workflow interruptions.</li>
<li><strong>AWS Bedrock Tool Result Merging</strong>: Improved AWS Bedrock integration by merging consecutive toolResult blocks into a single user message. This creates cleaner, more coherent conversation flows when using Bedrock models, making it easier to follow the agent's reasoning and tool usage patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow Image Artifact Handling</strong>: Enhanced workflow step processing to properly handle raw image bytes through the _convert_image_artifacts_to_images method. This fix ensures image data flows correctly through workflow pipelines, enabling reliable image processing and generation workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Filter Serialization</strong>: Fixed serialization of FilterExpr objects in GET /agents and /teams responses. This ensures consistent API responses when filtering knowledge bases, improving reliability for applications that programmatically inspect agent and team configurations.</li>
</ul>

    <title>datasets - datasets 4.6.0 - Enhanced Lance Dataset Support and Video Features</title>
    <link>https://github.com/huggingface/datasets</link>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <h3>🚀 What's New</h3>
<p>This release adds comprehensive support for Lance datasets with image, video, and audio types, introduces video-specific functionality for pushing datasets to Hugging Face Hub, implements cross-format deduplication for binary assets, and adds resharding capabilities for iterable datasets.</p>
<h3>💡 Why It Matters</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lance Dataset Type Support</strong>: Previously, Lance datasets could only handle basic scalar types. Now you can directly work with video, image, and audio blobs without manual type inference. This eliminates the need for custom type mapping and makes Lance datasets truly multimodal, allowing seamless integration of binary assets with metadata in a single table structure.</li>
<li><strong>Video Push to Hub</strong>: Before this update, pushing video datasets to Hugging Face Hub required complex workarounds or manual file management. Now you can directly push video datasets using Dataset.cast_column() with Video() type and push_to_hub(), streamlining the workflow for sharing video datasets and making it as simple as pushing text datasets.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Format Xet Deduplication</strong>: When converting between formats like Lance and Parquet, videos were previously re-uploaded, consuming significant bandwidth and storage. This update implements Xet deduplication that reuses binary chunks across formats, making format conversions nearly instantaneous and dramatically reducing storage costs when working with large binary datasets.</li>
<li><strong>IterableDataset Reshard</strong>: Large streaming datasets were previously limited to the shard structure defined at creation. Now you can dynamically increase the number of shards using reshard(), enabling better parallelization and load balancing for distributed processing without recreating the dataset, which is crucial for scaling up processing on large datasets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🛠️ Try It Out</h3>

# Create and push a video dataset to Hub
video_ds = Dataset.from_dict({"video": ["path/to/video.mp4"]})
video_ds = video_ds.cast_column("video", Video())
video_ds.push_to_hub("username/my-video-dataset")

# Reshard an existing dataset for better parallelism
ds = load_dataset("fancyzhx/amazon_polarity", split="train", streaming=True)
resharded_ds = ds.reshard()
print(f"Original shards: {ds.num_shards}, New shards: {resharded_ds.num_shards}")</code></pre>
